# AKLang Runtime System

A dynamic runtime system and memory management implementation in C, building toward an interpreted programming language.

## Motivation

Learning systems programming in C by implementing the foundational runtime components of a programming language - managing dynamic types, heap memory, and garbage collection from scratch.

## Current Features

### Dynamic Type System

- **Tagged unions** for runtime type identification
- Heap-allocated objects (similar to Python)
- Support for: integers, floats, strings, arrays

### Data Structures

- Dynamic Arrays
- Tries
- Heaps
- Hash Maps
- Advanced tree structures

### Memory Management

- Heap allocation for all objects
- Mark-and-Sweep Garbage Collector
